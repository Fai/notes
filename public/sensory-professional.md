# Sensory Professional

Recommended Reference : SCA - Sensory Handbook

Physiology & Sensory Attributes

- Your experience impact your sensory

## Screening Assessors

### Sensory Panel Selection

- Threshold Sensitivity
    - Detection - Lowest concentration perceptible
    - Recognition - Lowest concentration for identification
    - Difference - Concentration change necessary for perception of change
        - Reduce cost
    - Terminal - Saturation concentration, no perception of incremental change
- Intensity Ranking
- Bias Selection
    - Association Effect - The mind tries to relate the stimulus perception to the previous experience, when the same sensation was encountered.

### Sensory Panel Effectiveness

- Flavor wheel
    - The larger the gap, the more difference in sensory they are
    - Going from broader categories to smaller categories
- Sensory Lexicon
- Reference vs Standard
    - Standard - perfectly consistent, pharmaceutical grade tablet of sensory
    - Reference - reasonably consistent, manufactured product readily available

<aside>
💡 a common language of quality requires reference and standards. the sensory lexicon and flavor wheel are judgement neutral. Companies applied these tools in their judgement

- Descriptive Calibration

Calibrate with reference and products

### Q&A

How often should we calibrate

> Before you use the tools or panels, calibrate. Even if not using, calibrate regularly (6 months ~ 2years intervals)
> 

What kind of sensory perception drop with your aging

> Taste perception (Threshold) and Aroma (Detection threshold and Recognition, the recognition one can be recover by training)
> 

What we can do to prevent the loss of sensory perception

> Avoid smoking and vaping, Avoid putting something too hot into your month and take care of your health
> 

How do we know if our sensory perception aren’t up to the point anymore?

> The company will tell us, if you pass the calibration, you passed, if not, you might need more training or consider other option.
> 

### Threshold recognition level

Taste modality reference

- Bitter - Caffeine 0.3 g/L
- Sweet - Sucrose 6g/L
- Sour - Citric Acid 0.2 g/L

Adjust modality level using sensory science

- Sour 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8 g/L

- Use for roasting level, green quality, QC

### **Shelf-life**

- **Best by** date - **Quality** statement
    - Set up the set on the shelf and fresh roast and can see the difference
    - Sensory statistics table and see the difference
- **Use by** date - **Safety** statement
    - Coffee are not going to be dangerous, it’s going to stale.
        - Depends on how old, may get oily and woody.
        - Stale is Oxidized Coffee - Staling report from SCA
- Roasted on date, if not provided the best by date, are left the decision up to the consumer.

**To set up the shelf-life**

- Roast Profile : Set standard of flavor profile and flavor intensity of it
- CVA : Using Coffee Value Assessment System

    CATA - Check All That Apply Format & Intensity
    
- Duration and Frequency : Set period of time (duration) and frequency with the coffee assessment
    - Quality claim for product freshness from the package manufacturing, are the starting point.
    - Talk to your friends, peers and network
        - For example, might start at 6 months period and frequency bi monthly at the end of the week.
- When you taste and perceived the different from the roast profile, that’s how you get “**Best by date**”, looking for changing in descriptor, intensity
- Test the storage of how might your customer store your coffee. For example, the different kind of bags, air-tight container, etc. Compared it and you can also recommended customers together with the best by date, how should they store your coffee.
- Brew and taste just like how the customer taste it to control the variable.

> Practice made perfect, make sensory consistency

รอบที่ 1

A: Roasted, Dried Fruit, Nutty, Sour, Green - Salty, Sour - Fl10, Af10, Ac10 - Dry, Sw7, Mf8 - MD, O

B: Fl7, Af7 - Fruity, Sour - Salty, Bitter - Ac7 - Dry - Sw6 - Mf5 - MD, Rough, Astingency 

สรุป B เก่า

รอบที่ 2

A : More bitterness

C : Fr9, Ar9 - Floral → Grassy, Dried fruit, Nutty, Spicy, Fl6, Af4 - Roasted, Dried fruit, Nutty, Sour, Spicy - Ac8 - Sweet - Sw8 - Mf4

สรุป C เก่ากว่าเดิม → sharp high intensity, other is low intensity, short aftertaste, more rough, more dry → stale coffee

Sensory Apprentice - Taste and record

Sensory Analyst - Analyst, look for trend and outliner

- A should be the same, production operations checking (roasting)
- See the trend of the coffee sensory perception

Sensory Supervisor - Intepret the data and make the decision

> Measure by not what I like but what the specialty industry would want

Cupping

- brewing protocol
- subset of sensory analysis
- specific process
- consistent protocol
- intended use for quality, green, roast

Sensory Analysis

- Broadly applicable to many products
- Protocol to testing methods

### Cupping definition

Fragrance = Dry

Sniff and Describe, One round around the table since the coffee ground are time sensitive 

Water = 93 +-

Steel 3-5 min

Stir and break

Aroma = Wet

Slurp at three different temperatures

8~9.5 min after pour, check by touching to your lip

Hot 160f/70c - focus first on flavor and aftertaste ! Be careful not to burn your tongue - aerate to make the flavor get to the retro nasal 

- flavor
- aftertaste
    - How long
    - Quality

Warm 140f/60c - acidity, body, balance

Coke 100f/40c - defects, off-flavors

- uniformity - same enough (commercial significance) -> off-flavor
- clean cup - is it defect
- sweetness - can I perceive sweetness in this coffee

Cupping Protocol

- Sniff 2-3 times, lower your head, not pick up the cup
- don’t block the tray
- Rise spoon throughly
- rotate counter-clockwise

Learn flavor of
