# Observability Best Practice
[[Jirayut Nimsaeng (Dear)]]

Application Modernization Platform
- DevSecOps Tool
- CI/CD
- Modernized Infrastructure

Monitoring
- Gathers information passively
- Focuses on collecting data
- What happened?
- How did we fix it last time?

Observability
- Tries to understand information
- Focuses on giving data context
- Why did it happen?
- How we prevent it in the future?

SRE
- Engineers for reliability
- Balance reliability/features
- What's our reliability goals?
- How to automate the fix?

Three Pillars of Observability
- **Metric** are numeric representations of data. They fall into two main categories
	- Data that is already numeric
	- Data distilled into numbers
- **Logs** are stream of textual entries describing usage patterns, activities, and operations within an operating system, application, server, or another device
- **Traces** are the techniques of understanding what happened during a distributed transaction, such as a request initiated by an end-user and its effects across all downstream micro-services that were touched as a result.
