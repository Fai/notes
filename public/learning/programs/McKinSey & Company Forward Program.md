## Adaptability and resilience

****"In our lives, change is unavoidable, loss is unavoidable. In the adaptability and ease with which we experience change, lies our happiness and freedom." — Gautama Buddha***

- **Adaptability:** the ability to adjust or change based on the situation 
	- the ability to learn efficiently and apply that learning across a variety of situations
	- a state which you can develop through practice
- **Resilience:** the ability to stand strong in difficult times and face the situation
- **Psychological:** relating to the mind and emotions

Major drivers
- Activate learning: set intentions and develop positive learning habits.
- Strengthen personal adaptability and resilience: develop awareness of your mindsets and well-being
- Reinforce with purpose: Link your actions to personal and organizational purpose

Set Intentions to stay focused
- When was the last time you set a learning intention? What impact did it have?
- What new things are you excited to try and do? what kind of learning intention might you set?

Frame our intentions
- **Focus on the journey** prioritize the learning experience by framing desired outcome as learning intention rather than a performance goal.
	- I want to win the softball league -> I want to learn how to play softball
- **Link to meaning** by connect your learning experience to something personally meaningful
	- I don't get why i need to learn to fix car than just take it to repair shop -> if i learn how to fix a car, i can help friend and family when they in trouble

- What would it unlock for you (and your family, team, business unit or function, and your organization) if you were more adaptable and resilient?
- What will keep you motivated when things get hard?

If you would like, close your eyes for this visualization. Take a moment to ground yourself, place your feet on the floor, sit up a little, relax your hands. Now, take a few deep breaths. Imagine you are at a celebration one year in the future and everyone you care about is there and everyone is celebrating you. Think about what specifically they are celebrating. What have you created in the past year? What challenges have you overcome in order to arrive at this moment? In what ways have you positively contributed to the lives of the people you care about? 

Imagine a colleague you deeply respect comes up to say a few words. What do they share? What do they admire and appreciate about you? What impact have you had on them?

Now imagine a friend or family member comes up. What do they say? What do they admire and appreciate? How have you inspired them? How does it make you feel to imagine this? What are the things people shared that made you smile, that filled you with satisfaction? 

Now ask yourself, what are you most proud of? What motivated you to do those things, even if it sometimes felt hard or uninspiring in the moment? What brought you energy this year? How will you carry that energy into the future? Consider all of the thoughts that just came up for you. Together, they start to point towards your sources of meaning. They are things that will make your learning intentions even more powerful.
  
Spend as much time as you would like, continuing to reflect.

**Workbook Exercise 3**: What's your learning intention for this program?

**I want to ________** (insert verb here: _explore/practice/discover/understand/learn/develop/etc.)_ **how to **________****(_insert a capability/skill/mindset/attribute)_ **because** **________** (_insert something that’s meaningful/important to you)_ 

Example: I want to practice how to be mindful to others because I care about others and want to see them succeed

Key Takeaways
- **Choosing learning intentions vs. performance goals:** use learning intentions when developing a new skill and performance goals when you already have the skill and aim to achieve something with it
    
- **Focusing on the journey not just the outcome:** use this to improve your ability to learn and enjoy the experience 
    
- **Connecting personal meaning to learning intentions:** use this to strengthen your commitment to achieving your learning intentions

A line. At any moment, we either

	- ally, funny, curiosity, listen depy, speak unarguably, question beleifs of life, playful
	- be creative, productive
- Under the line: closed, defensive, commited to being right
	- _ not enough, 
	- there is a threat for approval, control, security
	- fault and blame, gossip, rationale and justiry
	- overwhelm for the sake of winning
Our physical brain programmed to see threat to our ego, tend to go below the line.
